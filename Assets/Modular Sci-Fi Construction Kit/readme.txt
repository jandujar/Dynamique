Thank you for purchasing the Modular Sci-Fi Construction Kit.

For a fast workflow, you should use Unity's build in Snap-To-Vertex Tool.
To use, select the object you want to place, then press and hold "v". Now move the mouse over a vertice of the object and the gizmo origin will be move to that vertex. Now press and hold the left mouse button to move the object around. When you get near another object's vertex, the object you are moving around will snap to the vertex of the object in range.
Also pressing and holding "ctrl" while rotating an object will rotate the object in steps of 15.
